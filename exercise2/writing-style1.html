    <h1> The Role of Money be in American Society Today??!</h1>

    <h1> <a href="#26">Money. </a> </h1>
    	<strong>$$</strong>.What’s with it? What do we do with it? What’s the point of it all? For anybody who has ever bought anything, <br>
    	<h1 id="2"><a href="#19"> Money</a></h1><br> 
    	is probably what they used to pay for it. Money buys us things. Things could be necessities to living, such as food and shelter, or things could just be supplements to our happiness, like premium television channels or that milkshake you bought last week. All of that is simple enough, but what should <br>
    	<h1 id="3"><a href="#9"> Money's</a></h1><br>
    	role in society be? Should it be something everybody should seek out? Should we respect people who have amassed large amounts of <br>
    	<h1 id="4"><a href="#30"> Money?</a></h1><br>
    	Obviously this is all debatable, but I am truly of the opinion that <br>
    	<h1 id="5"><a href="#22"> Money</a></h1><br> 
    	should, in an ideal world, play the most minute role in society. Anybody who has studied history knows that a lot of the worst things to ever happen could be stemmed back to people’s unhealthy obsession with <br>
    	<h1 id="6"><a href="#4"> Money</a></h1><br>
    	The pursuit of <br>
    	<h1 id="7"><a href="#14"> Money</a></h1><br> 
    	leads people to do crazy thing, and the most depressing part of it all is that <br>
    	<h1 id="8"><a href="#14"> Money</a></h1><br> 
    	does not even guarantee happiness. With all of that being said, I’ll take you on a trolley ride of fun ideas. <br>
    	<h1 id="9"><a href="#13"> Money.</a></h1><br>

    	TED Talks are great. Everybody always sounds extremely intelligent and enlightened, and they all use cool microphones attached to their heads. However, one in particular speaks to the notion that <br>
    	<h1 id="11"><a href="#1"> Money</a></h1><br> 
    	cannot buy happiness very aptly. The TED Talk, which was given by Michael Norton, an economist I assume, talks about happiness levels in relation to the way people their spend <br>
    	<h1 id="12"><a href="#34"> Money</a></h1><br> 
    	Essentially what he found was that when people spend <br>
    	<h1 id="13"><a href="#33"> Money</a></h1><br> 
    	on themselves, their happiness levels don’t go up. However, when people spend <br>
    	<h1 id="14"><a href="#30"> Money</a></h1><br> 
    	on others, their happiness levels do go up. It makes sense that spending <br>
    	<h1 id="15"><a href="#17"> Money</a></h1><br> 
    	on others would make you happier because helping others feels good, but what was surprising was the fact that people who spent <br>
    	<h1 id="16"><a href="#5"> Money</a></h1><br>
    	on themselves weren’t even a little happier. This contrasts sharply with the values I think a lot of us were raised with which essentially say that more <br>
    	<h1 id="17"><a href="#10"> Money</a></h1><br> 
    	affords us more goods and more peace and comfort, and thus we are happier. An article from the New York Times also speaks to this idea. In “Don’t Indulge. Be Happy,” we are told that as people make more <br>
    	<h1 id="18"><a href="#36"> Money,</a></h1><br> 
    	they tend to be happier, but only to a certain point. Once people make more than about $70,000 a year, which is considered a comfortable salary, more <br>
    	<h1 id="19"><a href="#6"> Money</a></h1><br>
    	doesn’t necessarily mean more happiness. Although we live in a capitalist society where <br>
    	<h1 id="20"><a href="#21"> Money</a></h1><br> speaks louder than anything, it seems that <br>
    	<h1 id="21"><a href="#12"> Money</a></h1><br> 
    	is simply not everything. According to Michael Norton, helping others does your happiness more good than helping yourself. What I think we as a society need to consider is whether we value happiness over senseless wealth. Though wealth can buy you things, what is the point of buying things when they won’t make you happy? <br>

    	Another reason why I feel <br>
    	<h1 id="23"><a href="#20"> Money</a></h1><br> 
    	should not play a large role in society today is the effect it has had on education in this country, particularly at the collegiate level. Crippling student debt has become an increasingly serious issue in this country as college tuitions have gone up at an alarming rate in the past twenty years. More and more students are taking on enormous sums of loans just so that they can graduate from college, but for what? Our society has placed such a large value on becoming financially successful that people think that it is okay to invest tens and hund<br>
    	<h1 id="24"><a href="#1"> Money</a></h1><br>
    	reds of thousands of dollars in<br>
    	<h1 id="25"><a href="#8"> Money</a></h1><br>
    	to something that may earn them more <br>
    	<h1 id="26"> <a href="#15">Money</a></h1><br> 
    	in the future. Because of this stress to make a lot of <br>
    	<h1 id="27"><a href="#28"> Money</a></h1><br>
    	we as a general society focus less on humanitarian work that is less lucrative, and more on professions meant to make us more <br>
    	<h1 id="28"><a href="#23"> Money.</a></h1><br> 
    	It’s always about <br>
    	<h1> <a href="#35">Money!</a></h1><br>
    	The reason why most kids going to college next year aren’t going to take up humanitarian jobs for careers is because they will be too busy worrying about making a paycheck that will allow them to repay their loans. The Planet Money podcast titled “What’s your Major?” speaks about what majors earn students the most <br>
    	<h1 id="29"><a href="#16"> Money</a></h1><br>
    	upon graduation. The top ten were, if I remember correctly, all in STEM fields. Public service majors were all in the bottom ten earning majors. This list is indicative of what our country values.. Rather than promoting majors that help other people by paying them decent salaries, we push our brightest to careers in engineering that in the long run may help people, but are not public service jobs. This all may seem like a criticism of the college system in this country, but the point is that the flawed college system is only a side effect of the larger, more underlying problem we have with <br>
    	<h1 id="30"><a href="#18"> Money.</a></h1><br> 
    	We make <br>
    	<h1 id="31"><a href="#21"> Money</a></h1><br> 
    	define everything and everybody. In a conversation I had with Fiona Wu, we talked about how people like Bill Gates and other multi-billionaires sort of ruin society. Though Bill Gates is a big philanthropist, that all just seems like a front. Nobody needs $80 billion. In my current mindset, if I were suddenly given that <br>
    	<h1 id="32"><a href="#23"> Money,</a></h1><br> 
    	I would only think it right to give it all to people who need it more. This is not because I am an extremely kind or caring person, though I try to act it sometimes. It is because there is no way to spend that all. People like Bill Gates and the rest of the richest one percent in this country hoard a disproportionate amount of the wealth, and leave the remaining 99% with next to nothing. The quality of people’s lives are at stake here. Money is not some obscure commodity; <br>
    	<h1 id="33"> <a href="#24">Money.</a></h1><br>
    	is what people spend their lives trying to possess. And so when asked what the role of
    	<h1 id="34"> <a href="#37">Money</a></h1><br>
    	in this country should be, I can only answer with something very small. Having 
    	<h1><a href="#11"> Money.</a></h1><br>
    	be something we value greatly only leads to greed, and I think that we as a general society would live more happily if we simply did away with this idiotic obsession with 
    	<h1 id="35"><a href="#27"> Money.</a></h1><br>
    	There is no simple way to change the paradigm that is short of a revolution, but it is nice to imagine at some point maybe my life won’t be defined by the amount of 
    	<h1 id="36"><a href="#11"> Money.</a></h1><br>
    	I can accumulate. Oh well. <br>
    	<h1 id="37"><a href="#20"> Money.</a></h1><br>
