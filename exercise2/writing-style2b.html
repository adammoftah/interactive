              What’s with it? What do we do with it? What’s the point of it all? For anybody who has ever bought anything, money is probably what they used to pay for it. Money buys us things. Things could be necessities to living, such as food and shelter, or things could just be supplements to our happiness, like premium television channels or that milkshake you bought last week. All of that is simple enough, but what should money's role in society be? Should it be something everybody should seek out? Should we respect people who have amassed large amounts of money? Obviously this is all debatable, but I am truly of the opinion that money should, in an ideal world, play the most minute role in society. Anybody who has studied history knows that a lot of the worst things to ever happen could be stemmed back to people’s unhealthy obsession with money. The pursuit of money leads people to do crazy thing, and the most depressing part of it all is that money does not even guarantee happiness. With all of that being said, I’ll take you on a trolley ride of fun ideas.
